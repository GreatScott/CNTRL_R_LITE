CNTRL:R LITE remote script is designed for easy-customization 
of Livid Instruments' CNTRL:R MIDI controller. This script should also
be easy to port to any other number of controllers.

Customization is performed in the file CNTRL_R_LITE_CONFIG.py 

See it for further instructions.

All the dirty bits are meant to be abstracted away.
